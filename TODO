The KDE 4.0 TODO List:
======================

=== ESSENTIAL FEATURES ===

- Proper transparency for Konsole windows

    ( Konsole currently allows the user to specify
      the amount of transparency for each color
      scheme, and change it in the settings dialog -
      what remains to be done is actually make use
      of that setting when drawing the terminal
      display )

- Input Method Event in terminal display widget

- Ability to define bold or transparent status for each
  color in the color scheme.  Make the setting of 
  boldness for characters more intuitive than in the KDE 3
  series.
 
- Editing of key bindings
  ( this is the list which maps key sequences pressed by
    the user to the corresponding text sequences
    which are send to the terminal )
- Allow the window title set by the terminal program
  to be used in the title bar of the Konsole window,
  and/or the tab for the relevant terminal session.

- Changing of profile used by current session

- Get the Konsole part working properly in other
  major KDE programs, such as Dolphin,
  KDevelop, Kate etc.

  Make as much of the functionality from the main 
  program available in the part as possible.  

- Make custom shortcuts work to create new sessions. 

- Implement changing of the Konsole window size by
  terminal applications.

- Implement a DBus interface for Konsole.
  Look for Konsole bug reports on bugs.kde.org containing
  the term "DCOP" for ideas on what users would like
  to be able to do using Konsole's scripting facilities.

- Changing of profile settings, changing of profile using
  a command-line tool 

  ( because going to the GUI to change a profile setting
    is slower for advanced users since it requires a switch from 
    the keyboard to the mouse.  Advanced users may also
    appreciate the ability to script profile changes )

== NON-ESSENTIAL FEATURES ==

- Automatic switching of profiles on 
    - Change of directory
    - Change of running program
    - Change of connection
    - Change of normal / root user command state

  Out of the box, provide automatic profile switching for
    - Normal / root command state
    - Possibly local vs. remote commands

  Again, for easier identification of what is going on in
  a Konsole window at a glance.

- Random background colors in color schemes, for easy
  identification of Konsole windows when several are open
  at once.

  -> Suggested in survey:  Random colors which are specific
  to the directory, program or host of the active session,
  using a hash of the dir/program/host name etc.

- Provide access to alternative navigation methods other than 
  tabs.  For sys-admins who use Konsole to access tens of
  different servers at once.

  eg.  List view

== USER INTERFACE ===

- Check the various dialogs etc. against the KDE 4
  HIG guidelines and identify problems.

  User interface guidelines can be found here:

  http://wiki.openusability.org/guidelines/index.php/Main_Page

== "ARTWORK" ==

- Design a small set of attractive color schemes to ship with Konsole
  in KDE 4.  Look in the developer-doc/research/konsole-survey-findings
  file for information on current Konsole user's preferred color schemes
  and comments on those colors.

  The color schemes need to be tested with popular terminal applications
  such as Vi, Midnight Commander and so on.

  They can be created using Konsole's built-in color scheme editor ( the 
  new KDE 4 one ).

=== KNOWN BUGS ===

- Some of the menu items are not showing up in the correct order,
  which produces menus that appear to have a strange layout to them.

  Find a fix for this problem.  May require kdelibs fixes.

- Launching of links when clicked on is not working properly.
  This only consists of one very simple line of code in Konsole which
  uses facilities from kdelibs - so the problem is likely
  incorrect use of the kdelibs class or a bug in kdelibs

=== TESTING ===

- Test various terminal applications in Konsole, particularly
  complex interactive ones and report problems encountered
  with them.

- Test the unicode support in Konsole, find text that
  doesn't display properly and fix that if possible.

- Test font support in Konsole, find fonts that do 
  not look correct ( compared with other KDE applications )
  or have other problems and fix them.

- General Konsole testing.  Find inputs that cause it
  to crash and burn and fix them.

- Test Konsole's terminal features using the "vttest"
  program produces by the Xterm authors.  Fix any
  bugs which that testing finds.
