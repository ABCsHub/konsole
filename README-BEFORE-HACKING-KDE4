Most of the front-end code ( including the Konsole part, the Konsole application main window,
menus, various additional dialogs and settings dialogs ) is being replaced entirely in
the konsole-split-view branch.  It is not being done directly in the 'konsole' directory
because other KDE 4 developers require a functional terminal whilst the replacment front-end
is being worked on.

The konsole-split-view branch can be obtained and built by navigating to your 
kdebase/apps directory ( which currently contains the existing 'konsole' folder )
and then running:

> svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/work/konsole-split-view

Or for contributors who have SVN read-write access:

> svn co https://svn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/work/konsole-split-view

You will then need to edit the CMakeLists.txt file in the 'kdebase/apps' 
directory and replace this line:

> add_subdirectory( konsole )

with this line

> add_subdirectory( konsole-split-view )


or you can switch to this branch:

cd kdebase/apps/konsole/
$ svn info
(prints the repository URL, for example https://svn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/kdebase/apps/konsole)
$ svn switch https://svn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/work/konsole-split-view
(i.e. replace trunk/KDE/kdebase/apps/konsole with branches/work/konsole-split-view)
$ make
(i.e. build and use it as usually)


Happy hacking :)
