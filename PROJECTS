Here is a list of open issues:

- when manipulating binary files, sometimes one
  screws up ones terminal settings.  xterm has
  a convenient 'hard reset' menu choice. Further
  sending signal from the menu to the client
  would be nice to have.

- keep session open after client program termination.
  Useful for things like 'konsole -e ls'.

* stuff centered around resizing and text vs. matrix:

  - make resizing more clever
    to see the issue, 'ls /dev', make window smaller
    and then larger again.
  - introduce the concept of "logical lines" for resizing and
    cut'n'paste.
  - selecting lines that wraps insert a '\n' in the middle of the
    line when pasting. A related problem occures with resizing.

* configuration related:

  - command line options
    - font, menu, scrollbar, schema, kdelnk ... other configs
  - write configuration utility for config (*.schema,*.kdelnk) files.

  - add configuration for function keys. <<< currently working on (LD)

* improve/complete documentation

  - document broken keypad (It's a QT issue really)
    see VT100 keypad codes (doc/missing.keys)
  - include README.* into doc.
  - explain configuration files

- deflicker, setting all the attributes separately
  both when creating and changing to a session
  creates 3 setimage and 1 paint events. (This may
  have improved, lately).
