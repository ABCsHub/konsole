- current issues -------------------------------------------------

- add configuration for function keys. (allmost done)
  document broken keypad (It's a QT issue really)
  document VT100 keypad codes (doc/missing.keys)

* configuration

  - partially broken (History, Transparency).
  - keyboard and codec selection unfinished.
  - command line options
    font, menu, scrollbar, schema, kdelnk, codec, keytrans, ...

* improve/complete documentation

  - include README.* into doc.
  - explain configuration files



* future stuff, perhaps ------------------------------------------

* stuff centered around resizing and text vs. matrix:

  [This needs a bit explaination]

  - make resizing more clever
    to see the issue, 'ls /dev', make window smaller
    and then larger again.
  - introduce the concept of "logical lines" for resizing and
    cut'n'paste.
  - selecting lines that wrap insert a '\n' in the middle of the
    line when pasting. A related problem occures with resizing.

* write configuration utility for configuration files.
  (*.schema,*.kdelnk.*.keytab)

- when manipulating binary files, sometimes one
  screws up ones terminal settings.  xterm has
  a convenient 'hard reset' menu choice.

- keep session open after client program termination.
  Useful for things like 'konsole -e ls'.

- deflicker, setting all the attributes separately
  both when creating and changing to a session
  creates 3 setimage and 1 paint events. (This may
  have improved, lately).
