    - Reimplement scrolling of view using keyboard
    
        KDE 3 shortcuts:    

        Shift+Up        - Scroll up one line
        Shift+Down      - Scroll down one line
        Shift+PageUp    - Scroll up one page ( == 1/2 number of visible lines in view )
        Shift+PageDown  - Scroll down one page ( == 1/2 number of visible lines in view )

        This used to be done in TEmuVt102::scrollView() , TEmuVt102::scrollViewPages() but
        that doesn't make sense when there is more than one view for each session,
        and only the active view should be scrolled.

=====================
    - More reliable syncing of menus when selected view changes.
      Currently the _pluggedController in ViewManager is only changed if the newly
      selected view gets the focus, and that might not happen automatically in some circumstances.

      Add a signal to ViewContainer which is emitted when the selected view changes.

      [FIXED - ViewContainers emit an activeViewChanged() signal when the user switches to a different view]
          
    - Open multiple views on a single session and make a selection in one or more of them
      the selection disappears when releasing the mouse

      [PARTIAL-FIXED    In KDE 3 Konsole clears the selection in a terminal display whenever another application
                        changes the selection.

                        Remove this behaviour for KDE 4.  Discuss on mailing list why this behaviour was there
                        in the first place and if it is still necessary to have it then find out what
                        can be done so that it works with multiple views on a session.

                        We still have the clipboard being set once for every view on a session whenever the 
                        selection changes.  This is inefficient.

    - Midnight Commander not always set to the right size when creating a new view

===================

    - Calling viewRemoved() in ViewContainer::viewDestroyed() causes crashes at exit.
      Start Konsole, create several shells then click X button on main window to close --> crash.
      Debug this.
   
      [WORKS - Don't delete objects directly in ViewContainer if possible, rely on the QObject parent-child
      mechanism to do that instead.  Use object->deleteLater() rather than 'delete object'
      -- Not absolutely sure about the safety of that fix.  See if there is a more correct solution]


    - Using ListViewContainer as view container:

      1.  Create a new shell
      2.  Split the view
      3.  Detach the view
      4.  In the newly created main window, select View -> Merge Windows
      5.  The new main window now has two list view items for the same terminal display (as expected)
      6.  Trying to activate the second entry in the list causes a crash

      [FIXED - Crash caused by session-view controller deleting a filter when destroyed.  
               Filter chains now delete the filters themselves ]

    - Using ListViewContainer as view container:

      1.  Create a new shell
      2.  Split the view
      3.  Unsplit the view using View -> Remove split.  Causes a crash

      [FIXED - See above ]



== NOTE: This TODO refers to the old Konsole code, before the start of a new front-end
         using KonsoleApp and KonsoleMainWindow.  Some parts do not apply to the new
         front-end
=========================================================================================

- [LATER]   Resizing a split view is currently quite slow, presumably because of the work
            done in TEWidget::resizeEvent() for each view.
            Find some way to fix this situation.

- [DONE] Kill views when the associated session dies
- [DONE] Single top-bottom split-view menu action
- [DONE] Use correct color scheme in terminal display
- [DONE] Ensure that when a new session is created, new views are created in all active containers.

- Fix all the parts of konsole_part marked "SPLIT-VIEW Fix"

- Prompt user when closing a session.  Ensure the same close prompt
  is shown no matter how the user closes the session.

- Update colour scheme of all views when user selects a new scheme via the Settings menu.

- Tab context menu
    - Send Input to All Sessions

- Tab-bar context menu
    - Auto-resize tabs
    - Dynamic hide
    - Tab options
        - Text & icons
        - Text only
        - Icons only
    - Tab-bar options
        - Hide
        - Top
        - Bottom

- Storage of view containers and views in Konsole class 
- Split-view functionality 
 
- Rename session
    - Allow renaming session by double-clicking on tab widget
    - Update items in the 'View' menu
    - Support case when "Set tab title to match window title" option is ENABLED
    - Support case when "Set tab title to match window title" option is DISABLED (ie.
            just session title should be shown)

    
- Terminal display context menu (when right-clicking in main terminal area)
    - Set Selection End
    - Copy
    - Paste

    - Close Session
  
- All code tagged 'SPLIT-VIEW Disabled' in konsole.cpp

- UI review of terminal display context menu 

- Update color scheme menu correctly when switching from session to session
